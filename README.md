# Ocearo UI

**Sailing Made Smarter**

**Ocean Robot** is set to transform sailing with an intuitive and visually engaging user interface (UI) designed for the OpenPlotter boat project. Powered by the **Signal K** platform, Ocean Robot gathers and stores boat data to provide real-time insights.

Inspired by Tesla's autopilot UI, this system delivers a futuristic and streamlined experience tailored for sailors.

## **Core Views**

### **Cruising View**
- **3D Visualization**: Provides a dynamic 3D view of the vessel, displaying critical elements such as:
  - Wind direction with laylines
  - Compass
  - Depth level
  - Nearby boats, represented in 3D using AIS data
  - Real-time sail adjustment recommendations based on wind conditions and sail positions

### **Anchored View**
- Simplified 3D representation of the vessel with key at-anchor data, including:
  - GPS position
  - Time
  - Tide levels
  - Depth
  - Battery status

![Anchored View](docs/anchored.png)

### **Park Assist View**
- Leverages camera and sensor data to simplify docking by:
  - Displaying trajectory predictions based on wind and rudder angle
  - Showing speed indications and live feeds from the front camera
  - Highlighting available berthing spots

*Currently in progress.*

### **Man Overboard (MOB) View**
- Features 3D visualization to pinpoint the location and direction of the person overboard, ensuring precise and timely rescue operations.

*Currently in progress.*

### **Other Views**
Additional visuals enhance the system's functionality:

## **Vision for the Future**
Ocean Robot's roadmap includes advanced features aimed at enhancing safety and efficiency for sailors:

- **AI-powered object detection** for floating debris and obstacles
  - Integration with advanced camera systems (e.g., **see.ai**) to detect floating objects
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Camera-based monitoring of sail indicators (*penons*) for optimal sail trim suggestions

## **Development and Deployment**

### Building


Clone sources:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/laborima/ocearo-ui.git
cd ocearo-ui
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install next react react-dom
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Access the UI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Edit the page by modifying `app/page.js`. Changes update automatically as you save.

### Boat Models

All 3D boat models have a waterline length of 10 meters and are positioned at 0 on the Y-axis. Use Blender to make any adjustments.

### Setup Tides Data

Create JSON files and stores tide data under the following path:

```
public/tides/${harbor}/${MM}_${yyyy}.json
```

A sample script allows downloading tide data for La Rochelle.

#### Example

After downloading, the directory structure for La Rochelle will look like this:

```bash
ls public/tides/larochelle/
01_2025.json  04_2025.json  07_2025.json  10_2025.json  download_data.sh
02_2025.json  05_2025.json  08_2025.json  11_2025.json
03_2025.json  06_2025.json  09_2025.json  12_2025.json
```

#### JSON Format

Each JSON file contains tide data for a specific month. The structure follows this format:

```json
{
    "2025-01-01": [
        [
            "tide.low",
            "11:38",
            "1.45m",
            "---"
        ],
        [
            "tide.high",
            "05:21",
            "5.95m",
            "80"
        ],
        [
            "tide.low",
            "23:56",
            "1.56m",
            "---"
        ],
        [
            "tide.high",
            "17:44",
            "5.7m",
            "81"
        ]
    ]
}
```

Each tide entry consists of:
- **Type**: "tide.low" or "tide.high"
- **Time**: The time of the tide event (HH:MM)
- **Height**: Tide height in meters
- **Coefficient**: If applicable, the coefficient value (otherwise "---")



### Setup Polar Data

The default POLAR file is based on the Dufour 310 (POL11111) from ORC-DATA.

For improved polar data, you can download a more accurate dataset from:

[ORC Data Repository](https://github.com/jieter/orc-data/blob/master/site/data/)

Save the downloaded file under:

```
/public/boats/default/polar/polar.json
```

### Setup Documentation

Create an `index.json` file and place it under:

```
/public/boats/default/docs/index.json
```

#### JSON Format

```json
[
    {
        "file": "a, c, e Series MFD Notice d_installation 87247-1-FR.pdf",
        "title": "Installation Manual for a, c, e Series MFD"
    },
    {
        "file": "Manuel propri√©taire Dufour 310 Grand Large_2019-06_FR.pdf",
        "title": "Owner's Manual for Dufour 310 Grand Large"
    },
    {
        "file": "p70 et p70R Notice d_installation et d_utilisation 81355-1-FR.pdf",
        "title": "Installation and User Guide for p70 and p70R"
    },
    {
        "file": "OpenCPN User Manual-4-8-6-Sept-18-18-medium-compressed.pdf",
        "title": "OpenCPN User Manual Version 4.8.6"
    }
]
```



## **Deploying to OpenPlotter**

Run the deployment script:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

### Adding to OpenPlotter Startup

Edit the LXDE startup configuration to launch the UI in kiosk mode:

```bash
vi ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
@chromium-browser --start-fullscreen --kiosk --disable-restore-session-state --app=https://localhost:3000/ocearo-ui
```

- `--kiosk`: Launches Chromium in fullscreen mode, preventing exit via keyboard shortcuts.
- `--disable-restore-session-state`: Prevents Chromium from restoring tabs after unexpected closures.
- `--noerrdialogs`: Suppresses error dialogs.
