All 3D boat models have a waterline length of 10 meters and are positioned at 0 and oriended allong the Y-axis. 


General Cargo Ship:
Create a low-poly white cargo ship with a boxy hull (10m waterline length, Y-axis), a raised bridge near the stern, two to three cargo holds with hatch covers, and small cranes or masts. Add a flat deck and simple railings.

Passenger Ship:
Build a low-poly white passenger ship (10m waterline, Y-axis) with a multi-level hull, several decks with rows of simple windows, a prominent bridge, and at least one funnel. Add lifeboats as small boxes along the sides.

Fishing Vessel:
Create a low-poly white fishing boat (10m waterline, Y-axis) with a narrow hull, a small cabin forward, an open working deck aft, and a simple mast or crane for nets. Add winches or net reels as cylinders.

Sailing Vessel:
Make a low-poly white sailboat (10m waterline, Y-axis) with a slender hull, a tall mast, a triangular mainsail, and a small cabin. Add a rudder and a simple keel below the hull.

Pleasure Craft:
Generate a low-poly white motor yacht (10m waterline, Y-axis) with a streamlined hull, a raised cabin with windows, a small flybridge, and a rear swim platform. Add railings and a sun deck.

Tugboat:
Create a low-poly white tugboat (10m waterline, Y-axis) with a short, wide hull, a tall wheelhouse, prominent bumpers (tires or fenders) along the sides, and a towing winch on the rear deck.

High-Speed Craft:
Build a low-poly white speedboat (10m waterline, Y-axis) with a sleek, pointed hull, an open cockpit with two seats, a small windshield, and an outboard motor at the stern.

Pilot Vessel:
Create a low-poly white pilot boat (10m waterline, Y-axis) with a compact, sturdy hull, a central cabin with windows on all sides, handrails, and a radar dome on the roof.

Search and Rescue:
Generate a low-poly white rescue boat (10m waterline, Y-axis) with a robust hull, an enclosed cabin, roof-mounted searchlight, lifebuoys on the sides, and a small radar mast.
